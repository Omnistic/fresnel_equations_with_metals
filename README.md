# Polarization Effects At Metallic Mirror Interfaces
Although it is thought early in introductory physics lectures the effect a metallic mirror can have on polarization is often overlooked.

The first time I was reminded about such phenomenon was during my time at Zemax, when my colleague Katsumoto Ikeda gave an answer to the question: [Why do I get an elliptical polarization after a 45-degree reflection in a mirror?](https://community.zemax.com/got-a-question-7/why-do-i-get-an-elliptical-polarization-after-a-45-degree-reflection-in-a-mirror-957)

I guess that for simplicity we are tempted to assume that mirrors do exactly that, they mirror what ever was coming onto them. And so why should they have any effect on the polarization?

In addition to what Katsumoto wrote in the forum answer, I wanted to give more insights into this topic by showing a simulation. I used the [Fresnel Equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresnel_equations) from Wikipedia.
